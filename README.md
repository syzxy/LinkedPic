A social media single-page-app(SPA), assignment of UNSW COMP6080 Web Front-End Programming 2020T1

To play around with the project locally:
- Start the server, you need python3 (>=3.6):
```
cd backend/
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 run.py
```
- Start the frontend with any http server, e.g: [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server), [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server)
```
cd frontend/
live-server
```
